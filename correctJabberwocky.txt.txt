twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
all misty were the borogoves, 
and the move raths outrage 

beware the Jabberwock, my son 
the jaws that bite the claws that catch 
beware the Jubjub bird and shun 
the frumious Bandersnatch!" 
he took his vorpal sword in hand 
long time the manxome foe he sought -- 
so rested he by the Tumtum tree 
and stood awhile in thought 
and as in uffish thought he stood 
the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame 
came whittling through the tulgey wood 
and bubbled as it came 
one two one two and through and through 
the vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
he left it dead and with its head 
he went galumphing back 
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock? 
come to my arms my bearish boy 
O frabjous day Callooh! Callay!' 
he chortled in his joy 

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
did gyre and gimble in the wabe; 
all misty were the borogoves, 
and the move raths outrage
